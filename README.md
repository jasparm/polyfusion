# polyfusion
3d display software

# Get started
### Requirements

### Setup
Once the repository has been cloned we need to setup the node environment.
```shell
cd polyfusion
npm install
```
We must then do the same for the front-end.
```shell
cd client
npm install
```  
A local instance can now be run.
```properties
npm run dev
```
