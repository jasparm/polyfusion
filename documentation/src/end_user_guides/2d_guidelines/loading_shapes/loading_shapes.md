# Loading Shapes

To load a shape, simply navigate to the load shapes icon on the left.

There will be a list of default shapes and custom shapes.

Default shapes include basic polygons like a square and triangle that will always be available.

Custom shapes are shapes that have been saved by the user.

To then load the shape, select it from the list and it will appear on the canvas where it was saved.
