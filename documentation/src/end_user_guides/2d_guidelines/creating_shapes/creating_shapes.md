To create a shape, begin by selecting the 'Create Shape' button on the toolbar.

Once this has been selected, you can click anywhere on the canvas to add a point.

At least 3 points must be added in order for the shape to be saved.

Multiple shapes can be added to the canvas at one time.

They can also be moved by simply clicking and dragging on one or more shapes.

While creating shapes, you can undo and redo points that you have made.

Additionally, shapes are ensured to be convex and you will notice that you cannot place points that will make the shape concave.
