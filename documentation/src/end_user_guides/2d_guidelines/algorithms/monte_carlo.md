# Monte Carlo IoU Estimation

The first algorithm that we have is our Monte Carlo Estimation.

To see this in action, ideally create two shapes of reasonable size and overlap them both such that there is a section of both shapes that is intersecting.

Then, navigate to the Monte Carlo Icon and select it to see it run.

Circles will appear on the screen.

Blue circles represent those in the intersection area, with red being those in the union area.

You can hit pause to pause the simulation and clear the canvas to end the simulation.
