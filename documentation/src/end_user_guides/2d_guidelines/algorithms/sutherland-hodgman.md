# Sutherland Hodgman Intersection

Our second IoU algorithm is the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm.

To see this one in action, overlap two shapes and select them both.

Once they are both selected, the intersection button will be clickable.

Click that button and the intersection area will be visualised and the resulting shape will be available to be used on the canvas with its area available to view.
