# Overview

This section will provide an overview on the 2d section of our project, outlining a suggested order for following our end user guidelines.

## Beginning

This is the canvas you will see after navigating to the 2d canvas.
On the left is the toolbar.

Each button will have its seperate functionality and will have tooltips that outline what it does.

Starting from the top button, I will outline briefly what each icon does.

1. Creating a shape
2. Selecting a shape
3. Editing a shape (only allowed when a shape is selected)
4. Load shapes
5. Save shape (only allowed when a shape is selected)
6. Intersection calculation (only allowed when two shapes are selected)
7. Monte Carlo Estimation
8. Undo (only works while creating a shape)
9. Redo (only works while creating a shape)
10. Clear canvas.

## Navigating The Guidelines
We suggest you begin with creating a shape, then look at selecting a shape, editing a shape, saving the shape, loading the shape and the algorithms section last.
