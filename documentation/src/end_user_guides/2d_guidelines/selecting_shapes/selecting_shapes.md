# Selecting Shapes

Shapes can be selected by firstly clicking on the select shape icon in the toolbar.

Various functionality is allowed when shapes are selected.

For example, when one shape is selected, we can edit it and save it.

When two shapes are selected, we can calculate the intersection between the two if there is one.

You can de-select a shape by clicking on it if it is selected and de-select all shapes by clicking on the canvas.

Selected shapes can be deleted by pressing the delete key.
