# Testing

The testing framework used is mocha. To begin, install mocha globally: `npm install -g mocha`.

To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and run `npm test`.

The tests are located in the `test` directory. The tests are organized by the module they are testing. For example, the tests for the `3d` module are located in the `test/3d` directory.
