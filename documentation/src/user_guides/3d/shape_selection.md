# Shape manipulation
A very important part of Polyfusion is the ability to manipulate shapes by moving them and adding new points to them.
## Shape Selection
A shape can be selected by left clicking on the shape. This will enable [movement controls](./shape_movement.md)

Selection can also be made from one shape to another.

Shapes can also be deselected by clicking off them into a blank space (or temporarily by holding shift). Shapes can be completely deselected by hitting the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.

## Shape Settings
Right clicking a shape brings up a menu to display information about the shape, save the shape, and modify the shape.

A shape can, but does not need to, be selected for this menu to appear.
