# Sidebar
The sidebar is key to interacting with a 3D scene most effectively. This section will cover all of its features.

There are 6 elements within the sidebar, which can be broken down into different types.

## Movement related
The first three buttons relate to movement of a selected shape. From top to bottom they are: translation, rotation, and scale.

Selecting an already selected movement state will deselect the shape.

## Adding shapes and algorithms
The next two buttons relate to inserting shapes into the scene and performing IoU calculations on them using various algorithms.

## Clearing scene
The final button clears the scene of all shapes present in the scene and resets it back to a blank scene.

This action cannot be undone so make sure you really want to clear the scene before doing it.
