# Adding vertices
PolyFusion allows the user to add additional vertices to the an already existing shape to transform it into a new shape.

First, select the shape you would like to add a vertex to.

Then, press the <kbd>i</kbd> key. This begins the vertex insert process for the selected shape.
Using the mouse, you can then select where you would want to insert the vertex, it will follow the mouse cursor around. Scrolling will move the vertex closer and further away from the camera.

Once an appropriate position is found, you can left-click which will add the vertex to the shape and update the shape to display it with this new vertex.

After a vertex has been inserted, there is currently no way to modify its position or delete it, so be careful and thoughtful with any vertex you want to add.
